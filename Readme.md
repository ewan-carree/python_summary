This PDF is meant to be a summary of all the knowledge that I've acquired during ENIB. It is also meant to be upgrade each time I learn something new or a new concept. I did it to use it in my whole life as I want to become a software developer.



Thanks to Corey Schafer, Tech with Tim, Kalle Hallden and Openclassroom because I've learned everything with them and I've used some of their code into this PDF.
